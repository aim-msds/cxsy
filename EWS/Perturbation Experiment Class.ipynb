    "The potential of dynamical systems to shift abruptly from one equilibrium to another triggers huge interest for attempts to prevent system collapses such as market crashes, aprupt climate changes or catastrophic shifts in fish or wildlife populations (Scheffer et al. 2009). The biggest challenge is to predict the “tipping points” where these sudden changes may happen (Scheffer et al. 2009). Several indicators have been pinpointed: critical slowing down, the so called flickering, an increasing autocorrelation, increasing variance and increasing skewness.\n",

    "\n",
    "The most prominent indicator in the conception of EWS is critical slowing down suggesting that a decreasing rate of recovery from small perturbations predicts the approachment of a tipping point (i.e. a critical transition). The next piece of Python-code generates a plot showing the above development with a small perturbation applied after reaching equilibrium (at  time  = 500). Testing different  r -values, the plot shows that recovery time increases with decreasing distance to the tipping point. In this case, in order to be able to intervene, the system is modeled in the form of a difference equation."

The following two pieces of code consider a time-lag of 1, indicating an increasing self-similarity of system states when approaching the tipping point. While the first piece just shows autocorrelation-values in relation to  r , the second piece visualizes the autocorrelation of data points in respect to four distinct values of  r . The plots position data points on the  x -axes in respect to their values at  t+1  on the  y -axes."

A uniform distribution would be the extreme case.\n",
